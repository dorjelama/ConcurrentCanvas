Document Processor - Parallel Programming Showcase
Introduction
This document outlines the process of creating a parallel programming showcase using a Document Processor example. The primary focus is on parallelizing the processing of a list of documents and benchmarking different approaches.

Example Implementation
DocumentProcessor Class
The DocumentProcessor class demonstrates parallelized document processing using different methods. Key methods include:

GenerateSampleDocuments: Creates a list of sample documents.
CountWords: Counts the number of words in a document.
ParallelForEachBenchmark: Uses Parallel.ForEach to process documents concurrently.
ForeachBenchmark: Utilizes a foreach loop for sequential document processing.
ForLoopBenchmark: Implements a traditional for loop for sequential processing.
Benchmarking
BenchmarkDotNet Integration
BenchmarkDotNet is employed to measure and compare the performance of different processing methods. The benchmarks include:

ParallelForEachBenchmark: Average execution time: 783.5 μs, Error: 33.69 μs, StdDev: 96.12 μs, Median: 811.9 μs.
ForeachBenchmark: Average execution time: 1,542.2 μs, Error: 81.84 μs, StdDev: 237.43 μs, Median: 1,523.3 μs.
ForLoopBenchmark: Average execution time: 1,285.3 μs, Error: 48.10 μs, StdDev: 141.82 μs, Median: 1,208.7 μs.
Interpretation
ParallelForEachBenchmark: Demonstrates the fastest average execution time among the three methods, making it suitable for concurrent document processing.

ForeachBenchmark: Displays a higher mean time, indicating slower performance compared to the parallelized approach.

ForLoopBenchmark: Falls between the parallelized approach and the sequential foreach loop, showcasing better performance than the latter but not as optimal as the former.

Recommendations
Parallel.ForEach Approach: Based on benchmark results, the Parallel.ForEach approach is recommended for concurrent document processing due to its faster average execution time.

Optimal Use Case: Consider using Parallel.ForEach when processing large sets of documents concurrently to achieve optimal performance.

Notes
Benchmark Variability: Benchmark results may vary based on specific use cases, input sizes, and environmental factors.
